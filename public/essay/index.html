    <!-- SECTION 1: The Opening Moment -->
    <!-- NICKY: Replace this placeholder with a real moment from one of your interviews.
         The ideal scene: a stranger who gave a rehearsed answer, then paused, then said something real.
         Keep it under 150 words. The more specific (what they were wearing, where you were standing,
         what the weather was like), the better. -->

    <p>
      I was standing on the corner of 14th and 6th, mid-afternoon, asking people questions with a camera. Most people gave me the polite version of whatever they were thinking and kept walking. One woman — mid-forties, headphones around her neck, clearly on her way somewhere — stopped for what I figured would be fifteen seconds.
    </p>

    <p>
      I asked her: <em>"What's something you've been wanting to say but haven't?"</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      She started with the expected answer. Something about being more honest at work. Then she paused. Not the kind of pause where someone's thinking of the next thing to say — the kind where the rehearsed answer ran out and the real one hadn't arrived yet. Six, maybe seven seconds of silence on a Manhattan sidewalk.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then she said: <em>"I think I need to tell my sister I forgive her. I've been carrying it for eleven years and she probably doesn't even know."</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="highlight">She didn't cry. She just looked surprised. Like she hadn't known that was in there until the question pulled it out.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      I've been doing this for a while now. Standing on sidewalks in New York, asking strangers questions, filming what happens. And that moment — the surprise on someone's face when they hear themselves say something true — I've seen it hundreds of times. It never gets less interesting.
    </p>

    <div class="divider">· · ·</div>

    <!-- SECTION 2: The Pattern -->

    <p>
      Here's what I didn't expect when I started: the questions barely matter. I mean, they matter — a lazy question gets a lazy answer. But the thing that actually changes the conversation isn't the question. It's the pause after. The three to five seconds where someone stops performing and starts thinking.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of our conversations don't have that pause. We talk in pre-loaded responses. "How are you?" "Good, you?" "Busy." "Same." It's not dishonest, exactly — it's just efficient. We're optimizing for speed, not connection. The pause is where the optimization breaks down and something unscripted shows up.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="highlight">After a few hundred conversations with strangers, I started to notice a pattern. It wasn't that people didn't have deep things to say. It was that they were waiting for permission to say them.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="pull">
      We don't have a connection problem. We have a permission problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      Think about the last time you were at a dinner party. There were probably ten things you wanted to say that you didn't. Not because they were inappropriate — because nobody else was going there. The energy in the room was set at a certain depth, and going deeper felt like a violation of the unspoken contract. So you stayed on the surface with everyone else.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's the permission problem. Everyone in the room wants to go deeper. Nobody wants to go first.
    </p>

    <div class="divider">· · ·</div>

    <!-- SECTION 3: Three Stories -->
    <!-- NICKY: These are placeholder stories based on the kind of moments you describe.
         Replace any or all of them with real ones. The more specific the details
         (name, location, what they said word-for-word), the stronger the essay.
         Each story illustrates a different facet of the permission problem. -->

    <p>
      I saw it with a group of college students I interviewed near Washington Square Park. Four friends, clearly close, finishing each other's sentences. I asked them: <em>"What's something you've noticed about someone here but never said?"</em> They all laughed nervously. Then one of them turned to another and said, completely seriously: "I think you're the bravest person I know and I've never told you that."
    </p>

    <p>
      The other three went quiet. Then, one by one, they each said something they'd apparently been holding. It took nine seconds for the whole group dynamic to change. Not because I said anything profound. Because the question gave them permission to stop being casual.
    </p>

    <p>
      I saw it again with two strangers at a coffee shop in the East Village. They'd never met. I asked them each a question, and within four minutes they were talking about grief — one had lost a parent six months ago, the other had lost a best friend the year before. They exchanged numbers when it was over. They didn't need a therapist or a support group. They needed someone to go first.
    </p>

    <p>
      And I saw it with a man in his sixties on the Upper West Side who told me, after I asked what he wished he'd noticed sooner: <em>"How happy my wife was. I spent thirty years trying to make her happy and I think she already was. I was just too busy to see it."</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Three different conversations. Three different strangers. Same pattern. The honest thing was already there. It was just waiting for a reason to come out.</span>
    </p>

    <div class="divider">· · ·</div>

    <!-- SECTION 4: The Deeper Problem -->

    <p>
      I think about why this is. Why does it take a stranger with a camera to get people to say the thing they've been thinking for months? Why do we need permission at all?
    </p>

    <p>
      Part of it is risk. Saying something honest is a bet. You're betting that the other person will meet you where you are, not punish you for going there. In most social settings, the expected return on that bet is low. You might get a weird look. An awkward silence. A topic change. So you stay safe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Part of it is practice — or the lack of it. Honest conversation is a skill, and most of us are out of shape. We're fluent in small talk, competent in debate, and almost completely unpracticed in the thing that matters most: saying what we actually think to someone who's actually listening.
    </p>

    <p>
      And part of it, I think, is that we've confused <em>connection</em> with <em>communication</em>. We've never had more ways to communicate. Group chats, social media, voice memos, video calls. We're in constant contact. But contact isn't connection. Connection requires attention, and attention requires slowing down, and slowing down requires a reason.
    </p>

    <p class="pull">
      The honest thing is already there. It's just waiting for a reason to come out.
    </p>

    <div class="divider">· · ·</div>

    <!-- SECTION 5: The Experiment -->

    <p>
      After enough of these conversations, I started wondering if the pattern could work without me standing there with a camera. What if the question itself was enough? What if you could create the conditions for that pause — that moment where someone stops performing and starts noticing — without a stranger on a sidewalk prompting it?
    </p>

    <p>
      So I ran an experiment. I took the questions that had consistently produced the most interesting conversations — the ones where people's faces changed, where the energy in the room shifted, where someone said something that surprised even themselves — and I put them in a sequence. Not random. Ordered. Starting with something light and observational, building toward something honest, ending with something that requires action.
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea was simple: one phone in the middle of a group of people. Tap to see the next prompt. No score. No timer. No winner. Just a sequence of things worth paying attention to.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="highlight">I called it Notice. Because that's what the whole thing comes down to. Noticing what's already there — in the room, in the people around you, in yourself — that you've been too busy or too polite or too scared to say out loud.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      The first time I watched a group play it, the same thing happened that happens on the sidewalk. Nervous laughter. A few quick, safe answers. And then the pause. Someone read a prompt and the room went quiet, and when they spoke, their voice was different. Not performing. Not clever. Just honest.
    </p>

    <div class="divider">· · ·</div>

    <!-- SECTION 6: What Happens When You Give Permission -->

    <p>
      The thing that keeps surprising me is how little it takes. You don't need a retreat. You don't need a therapist. You don't need to be in crisis. You just need a question that's slightly more honest than the current energy in the room, and one person willing to answer it seriously.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's it. That's the whole mechanism. One honest answer raises the ceiling for everyone. The second person goes a little deeper. By the third or fourth, the room is in a completely different place. Not because anyone planned it, but because the permission compounded.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've watched it happen at dinner parties, in dorm rooms, on first dates, at family gatherings where people hadn't said a real thing to each other in years. The setting barely matters. The mechanism is the same: someone goes first, and the room follows.
    </p>

    <p>
      And the thing people consistently say afterward isn't "that was deep" or "that was heavy." It's "I didn't know they felt that way" or "I've been wanting to say that for a long time." The conversations were already there. The questions just gave people a reason to have them.
    </p>

    <div class="divider">· · ·</div>

    <!-- SECTION 7: The Bigger Question -->

    <p>
      I don't think the world needs more content. I don't think it needs more hot takes or more opinions or more things to react to. I think it needs more moments where someone looks at someone else and actually sees them. Not their highlight reel. Not their LinkedIn summary. Them.
    </p>

    <p>
      That sounds like something you'd read on a motivational poster, so let me be more specific. I mean the moment where your friend tells you something they've been carrying and you realize you had no idea. Where a stranger says something so honest it changes your afternoon. Where you say something out loud that you've only ever thought, and the room doesn't flinch — it leans in.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those moments happen all the time in my interviews. They're not rare. They're just usually blocked by the same thing: nobody wants to go first.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="highlight">So I guess that's what I'm building. Not a game, exactly. More like a reason to go first.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      The rest takes care of itself.
