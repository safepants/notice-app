    <h1>Questions to Get to Know Someone</h1>
    <p class="intro">You can know someone for years and never really know them. Or you can ask the right question once and learn more in five minutes than five months of 'how was your day.' These work for anyone — new friends, dates, coworkers, or the person you've sat next to for a year.</p>
